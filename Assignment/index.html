    <h1>A Brief about myself.</h1>
    <h3>Hey there, my name is Kadiri Benjamin</h3>
    <p>Friends and frienemies alike call me Ben 👋🏽. I am currently enrolled in the Genesys Upskill program - website development section. I am literally a total newbie at web development, but I aim to go pro soon, very soon #smiles. I ventured into the world of web development earlier this year, dabbling around here and there until a friend of mine told me about the Genesys upskill program, and i was like "why not?" any avenue to learn web development is a big plus for me, especially if it's going to be free! 😅.</p>
    <p>Although i must say, web development has been fun so far, it's been very challenging, and i am open to challenges(i love challenges) 😅. I'm currently stuck at CSS; learning CSS Grid is not for the weak(Grid-template-columns, nth-of-type, and so on), and JavaScript was practically a roadblock! A no-go! so I'm just patiently waiting for mentors to be assigned to us, so i can get someone to put me through.</p>
    <p>Big thanks 🙏🏽 to Genesys Upskill for this opportunity. I promise not to waste it.</p>
